# **Module 5**: Introduction to Visualization

Module 5 explores how to visualize data effectively and includes topics such as plotting 3+ variables and visualizing big data. To do so, we will be learning the fundamentals of the plotting package `ggplot2` in `R`.

## For Deployment
The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.

Path: `~/modules/module5/`

file/directory | Deployed By:
---------------|-------------
`module5.ipynb`| Monday
`images/`      | Monday        
`labs/`        | Monday
`practices/`   | Tuesday
`exercises/`   | Friday


## Contents

The following is the entire contents of the directory. This directory is housed at the `MUDSA/DSAIntro` repository.

file/directory | description
:--------------|:-----------
`module5.md`   | outline of module activities and resources
`labs/`        | introductory notebooks to new concept materials
`practices/`   | less scaffolded version of lab notebooks
