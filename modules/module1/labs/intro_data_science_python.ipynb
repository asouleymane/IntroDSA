In this case, it opens the file `NationalNames1.csv` and then reads it. Since this is read in a single string, we need to `split()` the string on the `\\n` character that we discussed above. This puts it in a format of different strings, or what what may look like rows of data. However, we'll want to access different values within the rows, so in order to do that we need to split the rows by their delimiter. In this case, commas separate values, which is appropriate given the original file extension name `.csv`, which stands for \"comma separat*ed* values\". What this returns is a list of lists, which, believe it or not, makes the data easier to manipulate.\n",
