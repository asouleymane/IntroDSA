    "This is one of your first Exercise notebooks. In these notebooks, we will ask you to write and execute your own code for questions that will look similar to what we have learned in the Labs and Practices. However, Exercises will often be a bit more challenging in that 1) you may be working with a new data set with which you will have to familiarize yourself, and 2) you will be asked to write code to problems you have yet to see.\n",

We encourage you play get your hands dirty, and play around with this new data set to familiarize yourself with it. Be sure to follow the directions carefully and write as well as execute code in the designated cells."
