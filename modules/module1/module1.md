## Discussion topics
1. What would you consider to be a *data science* problem in your current job?
2. In he Practice Python notebook, you are asked to find the most popular name by count. Is this necessarily giving you the most popular name? Think about how you might go about finding a better depiction of popularity. Discuss your thoughts with your peers.
