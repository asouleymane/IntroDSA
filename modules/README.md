# **Module 7**: Basic Modeling Part 2

## For Deployment
The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.

Path: `~/datasets/mpg.csv`

**This is a new dataset to the `datasets` directory and therefore will need to be deployed.**

Path: `~/modules/module7/`
