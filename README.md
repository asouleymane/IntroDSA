# Introduction to Data Science

## Files/Folders:
  - **datasets/**: a directory of datasets to be used throught the course
  - **modules/**: a directory of teaching materials for each of the 8 modules
  - **notes/**: a directory of detailed notes per module
  - **course_schedule.md**: a schedule of topics to be covered over the course of the 8 modules
  - **original_syllabus.md**: the original syllabus for the *Introduction to Data Science* course
  - **resources.md**: a collection of resources for the course, the contents of which will not necessarily be used

1. All courses should have 8 modules, mapping to one week chunks of work
2. All the courses should have a common activity mapping
3. we have not yet determined this mapping, though we likely will soon (June, 2016)
4. One Idea:

  a. monday - video on concepts, concept readings

  d. Monday/Tuesday - Code walkthrough - Highly scaffolded example

  e. Tuesday - Slightly less scaffoled example using the same data

  b. Wednesday - discussion of concepts in a structured discussion board. For example, one common strategy is to ask students for examples from their work and life exprience related to the concept being taught. ... And to share a short description of how the concept/method/tech being discussed could be useful in that situation, had it been .. better understood .. for example ...

  c. Thursday - respond to the posts above for at least 3 **other** students. Make once comment to describe something you thought insightful, and add one comment that you think is critical or suggests an improvement ..

  f. Friday/Saturday/Sunday - Fully flushed out exercise that is used for assessment ...

      * Help Boards
      * Discussion
      * Worked Examples
