# Introduction to Data Science and Analytics (ILT)  [DATA_SCI 7601]
## Synopsis
*Synopsis:* This course is an introduction to the PSDS, its areas of concentration, and role of each concentration in data science. Students will receive an introduction to software, tools, and resources to be utilized through in the program. Students will learn of systematic methodologies for data science projects and the data science pipeline through review of case studies.

*Course Design:* This is a 2 credit hour / 3 day course. All three course days are Instructor Lead to facilitate discussions and build familiarity between students and instructors.

**Course Prerequisites: Admission to the program.
Course Grading: The course is evaluated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory completion.  See section XXXSPG**

## Objectives:

- Students will be able to compare multiple data sets and identify the strengths and weaknesses of each data set in terms of data quality and suitability for answering a particular set of questions.
- Students will be able to identify software tools and algorithms appropriate for analyzing large data sets
- Students will be able to compare multiple data sets and identify the strengths and weaknesses of each data set in terms of data quality and suitability for answering a particular set of questions.
- Students will be able to integrate data sets from multiple sources, using appropriate software and data storage technologies.
- Students will be able to develop visualizations that use domain relevant indicators to illustrate categorical differences in sets of data.
- Students will demonstrate the ability to apply data, data preparation techniques, machine learning, visualization and computational modeling to tell compelling stories to consumers of their analysis.

## Methodology:
This course employs numerous methods to accomplish the objectives including: discussion using the Socratic method, demonstration, individual, team and class activities, role plays, self-evaluation, learning instruments, video, and short reading assignments (optionally for homework).  The course is experiential; that is students will think about their thinking using the ORID* method:
- Objective Observation
- Reflective Observation
- Interpretation
- Decision making

Lastly, students will create a personal action plan designed for implementing changes in their thoughts and behaviors and continually improving their ability to think.

## Learning Resources
- Boot Camp Material for SQL, R, and Python
- Online resources, tutorials, and course notes

## Tools
- R Statistical Programming
- iPython Notebook
- Google BigQuery
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
